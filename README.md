does it matter which order the three words appear in? Edit the TicketMachine class to try different orderings. After each change, close the editor. Does the appearance of the class diagram after each change give you a clue as to whether or not other orderings are possible? Check by pressing the Compile button to see if there is an error message. Make sure that you reinstate the original version after your experiments!


## Is it always necessary to have a semicolon at the end of a field declaration? Once again, experiment via the editor. The rule you will learn here is an important one, so be sur
```
public Student(String name)
```
## How many parameters does the following constructor have, and what are their types? 3. the first is whether . the second is the class. the last is the int. value

## Suppose that the class `Pet` has a field called `name` that is of the type `String`. Write an assignment statement in the body of the following constructor so that the `name` field will be initialized with the value of the constructor’s parameter.
```
public Pet(String "Sam")
{
}
```
## The following object creation will result in the constructor of the `Date` class being called. Can you write the constructor’s header?
```
new Date("July", 15, 1989)

Try to give meaningful names to the parameters.
